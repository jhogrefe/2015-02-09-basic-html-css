    <h1>Adding Images to an HTML Page</h1>
    
    <p>
       Adding media (images and video) are fairly essential in making your HTML look nicer. You can use images to just show photos of yourself or something you are interested in, or as a visual aid for the content you are displaying on your web page.

    <h2>Adding Images</h2>
     
    <p>
       What you enter to place an image in HTML is constant. You will use the same format every time. Now might be a good time to talk about where to store everything on your web server because you're starting to call for additional items to fill your page.
       Ideally, it's a good idea for you to place whatever images you are going to use in a subdirectory called "images". That means place the image in a directory (a folder called "images") under the directory where your web pages are located (which would be the "root" directory for your site).<br><br>
       Then enter the following HTML code to link to that image:<br><br>
       &ltimg src="images/image_name.jpg" alt="description of image"&gt
    </p>
    
    <p>
       If all works well, your image should appear on your HTML page:
    </p>
    
    <p>
       <img src="../images/cat1.jpg" width="600" height="400" alt="Cat1">
    </p>

<a href="lists.html" id="" title="lists">Next</a><br>
<a href="index.html" id="" title="index">HTML Home</a>
