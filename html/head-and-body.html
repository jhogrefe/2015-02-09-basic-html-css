    <h1>Everybody Needs a Head and Body!</h1>
    
    <p>
       Every HTML page needs a Head and Body section to function. The differences are described below.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Head</h2>
     
    <p>
       The head section is generally used to contain information about the page that you don't necessarily see, like the meta keywords/descriptions, title of a page and embedded CSS styles (if not following the recommended convention of using external CSS style sheets). You can also link to other external files here (for example, javascript), as these need to load before the page is displayed. <strong>HTML functions from top to bottom in a linear fashion.</strong><br><br>
       The Head tags are:<br><br>
       &lthead&gt&lt/head&gt
    </p>
 
    <h2>Body</h2>
     
    <p>
       You enter whatever content you want displayed in the body.<br><br>
       The Body tags are:<br><br>
       &ltbody&gt&lt/body&gt
    </p>
