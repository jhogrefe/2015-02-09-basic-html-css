    <h1>A Handy CSS Reference List</h1>
    
    <p>
       Well, I had every intention of listing out some of the more popular CSS attributes, but then I saw the ridiculously long list of what was available, so I think it best to simply reference one of the better sites to find what what you need: <strong>It's the Mozilla Developer Network</strong>.
    </p>
     
    <p>
       I couldn't find any references to cat attributes, so you are safe! <a
